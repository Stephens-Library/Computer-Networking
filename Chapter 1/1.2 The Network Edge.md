# The Network Edge
We will dive a bit more deeply into the components of a computer network

To begin this section, we take a look at the edge of a network, namely computers, smartphones, and other devices

In the next section we'll move from the network ege to the network core and examine switching and routing in computer networks

End systems are also referred to as *hosts* because they host application programs such as a Web browser program, an e-mail client program, or an e-mail server program, the terms hosts and end systems will be used interchangeably

Hosts are sometimes further divide into two categories **clients** and **servers**, informally, clients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers tend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream videos, relay e-mail and so on

Today, most of the servers reside in large **data centers**, for example Google has 50-100 data centers, including about 15 large centers, each more than 100,000 servers

## Access Networks
Having considered the applications and end systems at the "edge of the network" let's consider the access network, the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the "edge router"), it is the first segment of data transmission before traffic is forwarded to a broader network, such as an ISP backbone

Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access (high-speed Internet access for homes) are **digital subscriber line (DSL)** and cable

A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phones access

Thus, when DSL is used, a customer's telco is also its ISP, each customer's DSL model uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco's local central office (CO)


The home's DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals from many such houses are translate back into digital format at the DSLAM

Okay! That was a handful so I'll break everything down one by one

In the term **Broadband Residential Access**, Broadband means "high-speed Internet" (unlike old-school dial-up Internet) and of course, residential access means Internet's that used in peoples homes

**DSL** stands for **Digital Subscribe Line**, it's a way to **get Internet access using your telephone line**
1. Every house already has a telephone line made of twisted-pair copper wires, this is the same wire used for regular landline phone calls
2. Instead of using this wire only for phone calls, DSL allows us to send **Internet data** over it
3. Your house needs a **DSL modem**, a **modem** (short for modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts **digital Internet data** into a form that can travel over phone wires
4. This **DSL model** sends data through the phone wires to a device called a **DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer)** in a **telephone company's office**
5. The DSLAM takes the signals from many houses and connects them to the Internet

In short, DSL shares your phone line between Internet and phone calls, you can talk on the phone and use the Internet at the same time

A DSL divides the telephone line into **three frequency bands** so it can send **three different types of signals** at the same time, this allows for both phone calls an the Internet, this includes a high-speed downstream channel (internet download), a high-speed upstream channel (internet upload), and an ordinary two-way telephone channel (phone calls)
