# What is the Internet?
In this book, we'll use the public Internet, a specified computer network, as our principal vehicle for discussing computer networks and their protocols

But what is the internet?

We can answer this question in two ways, first we can describe the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, the basic software and hardware components that make up the internet

Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

## A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
The internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world

Not too long ago these computing devices were primarily PCs, Linux workstations, and servers

Increasingly though, non-traditional Internet "things" such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, and more are being connected to the Internet

Indeed, the term *computer network* is beginning to sound a bit dated, given the many non-traditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet

In Internet jargon, all these devices are called **hosts** or **end systems**, bu some estimates in 2015 there were about 5 billion devices connected to the Internet, and the number skyrocketed towards 25 billion by 2020

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**

Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds the header bytes to each segment

The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links, packet switches come in many shapes, but the two most prominent today are **routers** and **link-layer switches**

Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destination

Link-layer switches are typically use in access networks, while routers are typically used in network core

The sequence of communication links and packet switches traverse by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system, known as a **route** or **path** throughout the network
