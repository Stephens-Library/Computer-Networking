# What is the Internet?
In this book, we'll use the public Internet, a specified computer network, as our principal vehicle for discussing computer networks and their protocols

But what is the internet?

We can answer this question in two ways, first we can describe the nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, the basic software and hardware components that make up the internet

Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications

## A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
The internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world

Not too long ago these computing devices were primarily PCs, Linux workstations, and servers

Increasingly though, non-traditional Internet "things" such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, and more are being connected to the Internet

Indeed, the term *computer network* is beginning to sound a bit dated, given the many non-traditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet

In Internet jargon, all these devices are called **hosts** or **en systems**, bu some estimates in 2015 there were about 5 billion devices connected to the Internet, and the number skyrocketed towards 25 billion by 2020

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**

Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measured in bits/second

When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds the header bytes to each segment

The resulting packages of information, known as **packets** in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links, packet switches come in many shapes, but the two most prominent today are **routers** and **link-layer switches**

Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destination

Link-layer switches are typically use in access networks, while routers are typically used in network core

The sequence of communication links and packet switches traverse by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system, known as a **route** or **path** throughout the network

Packed-switched networks (which transports packets) are in many ways similar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which transport vehicles)

Consider, for example a factory that needs to move a large amount of cargo to some destination warehouse located thousands of kilometers away

At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of trucks, each of the trucks then independently travels through the network of highways, roads, and intersections to the destination of the warehouse

At the destination warehouse, the cargo is unloaded and grouped with the rest of the cargo arriving from the same shipment

Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, communication links are analogous to buildings, just as a truck takes a path through the transportation layer, a packet takes a path through a computer network

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**, including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate ISPs; university ISPs; ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee shops, and other public places

Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links, ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL, high-speed local area network access and mobile wireless access

ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web sites and video servers directly to the Internet, the internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the internet

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** an the **Internet Protocol (IP)** are two of the most important protocols in the Internet, the IP protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent an received among routers and end systems, the internet's principal protocols are collectively known as **TCP/IP**

**Internet standards** are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the IETF standards documents are called **request for comments (RFC)**, RFCs started out as general requests for comments to resolve network and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet

RFCs tend to be quite technical an detailed, they define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for e-mail)

There are currently more than 7,000 RFCs, other bodies also specify standards for network components, most notably network links

The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee, for example, specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFI standards
